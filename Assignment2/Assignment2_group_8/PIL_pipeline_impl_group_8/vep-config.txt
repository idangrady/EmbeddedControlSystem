## - partitions can only have a memory size of 32K or 64K
## - the size of all partitions on a tile must be at most 96K
##   (i.e. 128K including the system application)
## - default memory is 32K, default stack is 4K
##
## use /opt/riscv/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-size [-A] *.elf

on tile 0 partition 1 has 64K memory and 4K stack
#on tile 0 partition 2 has 32K memory and 4K stack
#on tile 0 partition 3 has 32K memory and 4K stack

## scheduling
##
## - max 3 slots per tile
## - it is allowed to not schedule anything on a tile
## - a partition can have more than one slot
## - the system partition always get a slot of 5000 cycles 
##   at the end: you don't have to add this
##
#on tile 0 next slot is for partition 1 with 200000 cycles
on tile 0 next slot is for partition 1 with 2000000 cycles
#on tile 0 next slot is for partition 2 with 56000 cycles
#on tile 0 next slot is for partition 1 with 71000 cycles
on tile 1 next slot is for partition 1 with 791000 cycles
on tile 2 next slot is for partition 1 with 791000 cycles
# on tile 2 next slot is for partition 2 with 10000 cycles
# on tile 2 next slot is for partition 3 with 100000 cycles
